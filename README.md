# Falsified Statement Detector (FSD) - README

## PROLOGUE
Hey Buddies,

It is my pleasure that you are spending time to watch my trivial tool. Falsified Statement Detecotr (FSD) was my the project of my undergraduation thesis one year ago, and it has not been maintained anymore after my dissertation defense - that is the reason why it is still a prototype.

I am planning to restart the plan to fulfill it with more useful functions. Still I am engaged in my postgraduation application - I swear I would devote myself in FSD's remaking as if the application was finished.

FSD is designed to help user to make a rough judgment on whether a published company published falsified financial statement. FSD was originally for IPO, but the inner working is common so it could be easily extended to other auditing situations.

For more information about how FSD works, please read down and see my undergraduation thesis in the folder.
